# OnePage Apps

This repository hosts one-page web applications. Each app lives in its own subdirectory and can be served directly via GitHub Pages.

Hosted domain (custom CNAME): `onepage.traefikturkey.com`

## How this repo is organized

- Each subdirectory under the repo root contains a single-page app (an `index.html` or an HTML file at the top level of the subdirectory).
- For quick previews, open the HTML files directly in the browser or use GitHub Pages to serve the site.

## Apps index

- chat-command-matcher — /chat-command-matcher/
  - File: `chat-command-matcher/chat-command-matcher.html`
  - Link (raw file): `chat-command-matcher/chat-command-matcher.html`

- hcl_linter — /hcl_linter/
  - File: `hcl_linter/hcl_linter.html`
  - Link (raw file): `hcl_linter/hcl_linter.html`

## Publish to GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub (make sure the `CNAME` file is present with `onepage.traefikturkey.com`).
2. In the repository Settings → Pages, select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)` and save.
3. Confirm the DNS CNAME in Cloudflare points `onepage` to `<your-github-username>.github.io` with the proxy disabled (grey-cloud).

## Notes & recommendations

- Consider adding a simple `index.html` at the repo root that lists and links to each app directory for a nicer landing page (GitHub Pages will serve it at the site's root).
- If you want a separate URL per app (e.g., `app1.onepage.traefikturkey.com`), create separate repos or use subpaths and configure routing in your Traefik/Cloudflare setup.
- I can add a generated root `index.html` that provides clickable tiles for each app if you'd like.
